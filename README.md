Topic/data: A sushi dataset on 100 different types of sushi, with the “major” and “minor” sushi groups that each belongs to, and each sushi’s “style” - maki (wrapped) or not. The data was collected on 5000 people ages 15 to 60 all across Japan, and the respondents were asked to rate how “heavy/oily” each sushi is, how often they eat it, the price, and how often they think it is sold in shops. The dataset we are using has the averages of these ratings.
